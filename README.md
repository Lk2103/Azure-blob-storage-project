# azure-blob-storage-project
A project demonstrating the use and functionality of azure blob storage service

**Project Overview**

This project has been formulaited to demonstrate the use of azure blob storage and potentially other azure storage services in a real world business context. I have chosen to carry on a previous conecpt idea of a Computer marketplace. This could be useful within this sort of business because it means that the company can keep a log of the devices sold within a given period.

**Architecture/Design decisions**
Due to the nature of the concept either azure tables services or azure blob storage would be the correct services to use. In some cases it could be ideal to use both blob and azure table(as an archive) services but, in this case I will only be using blob.
Local Redundant Storage was chosen to minimise the cost of the project as a whole. 

**What I learnt**
I learnt how to create a storage account and provide storage solutions for clients.
The ideal scenarios in which Azure blob should be used(when nonstructured images and text are involved) and azure tables(for unstructure non sql data essentially allowing you to filter to bigger grooups of data together ideal for big archives)
**Cleanup and Cost Managment**
